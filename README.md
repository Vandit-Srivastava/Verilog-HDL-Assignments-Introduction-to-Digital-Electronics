# Verilog-HDL-Assignments-Introduction-to-Digital-Electronics
I have uploaded the Verilog HDL codes for the assignments that I had done in the 2022 fall semester under the course 'Digital Electronics' at IIT-Delhi.
exp6) A mod 3 counter made using Toggle flip flops and tested on a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD).
exp7) A 4 bit gray code counter made using SR flip flops and tested on a Complex Programmable Logic Device (CPLD).
